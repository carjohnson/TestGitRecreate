Classifier Parameters:

The parameters of a classifier consist of the data required for that classifier to make a guess on testing data.
A classifier's parameters therefore only exist after training has occurred.
The parameters that a certain classifier has can differ between types of classifiers. For example, a simple 2D linear
classifier's parameters would be the "m" and "b" values to describe the decision boundary of y=mx+b. A neural network's
parameters would be the weights and biases of the neuron connections.
A classifier's parameters are determined during training, and are therefore a function of:
 1) The training data
 2) The type of classifier
 3) The chosen hyperparmaters for the classifier


Classifier Hyperparameters:

A classifier's hyperparameters are non-constant values that determine how the classifier's parameters will be 
determined during training. By changing the hyperparameters, a classifier's parameters may change even if the
training data used remains constant.
Examples of hyperparameters may be the number of neighbours for a nearest neighbour classifier, or the type of 
regression used by a linear classifier.
Hyperparameters can be set directly by the user, or they can be optimized by performing hyperparameter optimization.
For hyperparameter optimization, some hyperparameters may be optimizable, while others may have to be determined
manually, depending on the hyperparmaeter optimization framework used.
